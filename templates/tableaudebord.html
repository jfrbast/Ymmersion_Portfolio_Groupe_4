                    Having taken note of specifications, we started to organize ourselves. We created a
                    <span class="gras">Miro</span>, a <span class="gras">Trello</span>, and a discussion group to share files and images together.
                    We divided up the tasks and started working.

                    In the afternoon, the second challenge arrived—Thibaut took it on. A program was needed,
                    like a "guess the price" game, where you choose a number and the program tells you if it’s higher or lower (see challenge 2).

                    added the <span class="gras">Portfabio</span> page.
                    We took photos of a door, of Fabio, of Fabio on a door, Fabio in front of the door—funny moments like these.
